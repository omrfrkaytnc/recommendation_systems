# Recommendation Systems

This repository contains the course contents of the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp - Recommendation systems Module I attended. I've organized module into three main categories:

## Datasets
This folder contains datasets used in both lectures and case studies.
Notes : "As the sizes of the datasets are large, I did not upload them."

## Course Training and Application
Here, you can find materials related to the course curriculum and practical applications covered during the bootcamp.

## Case Studies
This folder encompasses the application of what we learned during the modules. With careful preparation, I hope this work will benefit those interested in data science.

### Recommendation Systems
- Content Based Recommendation
- Item Based Collaborative Filtering
- User Based Collaborative Filtering
- Model Based Matrix Factorization
- Case 1: ARMUT ARL Recommender
- Case 2: Hybrid Recommender System
